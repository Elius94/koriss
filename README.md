# Psychologist React.js Material UI Typescript Static Website

I decided to make opensource the site I made for my girlfriend (Psychologist). The site is made in React.js v17 and is based on the famous and stable CRA (create-react-app). The UI is completely Material, starting from the free template [onepirate theme](https://material-ui.com/store/items/onepirate/) in Typescript.
The template has been optimized by [Andrew Rothbart](https://github.com/rothbart/onepirate-typescript) with a little code review done by me to update it to the latest versions of material ui.

I put a workflow in which through a github action I automatically publish the site on the hosting via FTP after a release and in complete security.
